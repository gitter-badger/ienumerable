### Noop function
"Do nothing" function

### True function
Function that always returns `true`

### Identity function
Identify a function that always returns the same value that was used as its argument. We can write it in JavaScript like this

```js
const identityFunction = (x) => {
  return x;
};
// const result = identityFunction(5);
// result === 5
```

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_function) is its mathematical definition.
